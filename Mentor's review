The project proposal has been reviewed by the mentor.
Following are the comments of the mentor.

  1 Regarding adding editor hooks.
  
    Comment: One of the biggest issues with editors that do not run in a terminal is that there is often not an 
    implicit working directory, so on top of configuring hooks it would also have to determine a working directory
 
  
  2 Regarding standardizing the command line by bringing it more in-line with how other UNIX tools behave, thereby making 
    Firetowerâ€™s command parsing more robust.
  
    Comment: This is huge. What exists right now is quite sloppy. It would probably be easier if this happened before 
    named or multiple-per-directories.
  
  3 Regarding checking cross-terminal compatibility
  
    Comment: Firetower make heavy use of PIDs and UNIX signals, I have no idea of how well it would play with windows. 
    Very low on my priority list.
    
  4 Regarding the timeline
    
    Comment:A heads up,the hooks are completely different from the core firetower code. There is nothing about them 
    that they couldn't be done in tandem,depending on team size or what people are interested in.
    
    The proposal has been modified keeping these comments in mind.
